## Why Ziggeo's iOS SDK? <a name="why-us"></a>

Ziggeo is powerfull whitelabel video SAAS that helps people be part and lead the video revolution. It has award winning multimedia API and its CEO and CTO can often be seen talking in various events around the world.

Ziggeo's iOS SDK is utilizing the API to bring you a native library you can add to your project. Just add to project and allow your application evolve into something much more, something video!

It offers you pre-built functionality to call and manipulate. This library also offers you direct access to the Ziggeo API as well if you want to do more things yourself.

### Who it is for?

Do you have a complex iOS app that is missing that one key ingredient - the video?

Do you need a video library that can be seamlesly integrated into your existing app?

Want something that is simple and easy to use?

You need some powerful features high end video apps provide?

Want to provide a great video experience for your own customers?

If any of the above is "Yes" then you are in the right place as this SDK is for you!

### Other Mobile SDKs

Did you know that Ziggeo offers several different SDKs for you to choose from? You can see all of our mobile SDKs [within our docs](https://ziggeo.com/docs/sdks/mobile/).

## Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

### Download <a name="download"></a>

You will want to either download the SDK zip file or to pull it in as git repository into your own project.

### Dependencies<a name="dependencies"></a>

Please use latest build tools and sdk version when compiling.
- Add NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription, NSCameraUsageDescription and NSMicrophoneUsageDescription sections into the info.plist file

### Install<a name="install"></a>

iOS Objective-C SDK offers you several ways to add Ziggeo to your project. The recommended is through CocoaPods

#### CocoaPods Support (optional)

- Install CocoaPods
```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

- Create new iOS project
- Init pods in the xcode project directory
```
$ pod init
```

- Add framework to Podfile
If you are going to be using the SDK flavor with background blurring, you need to set the `ENABLED_BITCODE` option to `No`, otherwise you will not be able to compile your app.
So if your app needs to set the `ENABLED_BITCODE` option to `Yes`, you can not use the SDK flavor with background blurring.
In this ase, use
```
pod 'iOS-Client-SDK', :git => 'https://github.com/Ziggeo/iOS-Client-SDK.git'
```

If your app does not need to set the `ENABLED_BITCODE` option to `Yes`, you can use the SDK flavor with background blurring.
In this ase, use
```
pod 'iOS-Client-SDK', :git => 'https://github.com/Ziggeo/iOS-Client-SDK.git', :branch => 'blurring'
```

- Install framework
```
$ pod install
```

- Reopen the project using the .xcworkspace
- If you use the SDK flavor with background blurring, set `ENABLED_BITCODE` to `No`"** on the *Build Settings* of the project.

## Demo<a name="demo"></a>

[This repository](https://github.com/Ziggeo/iOS-Client-SDK) has "samples" directory which would allow you to see how it can be used.

## Codes<a name="codes"></a>

This section will introduce you to the most common ways you would integrate our video library into your app.

### Init<a name="init"></a>

```
#import "Ziggeo/Ziggeo.h"

Ziggeo* m_ziggeo = [[Ziggeo alloc] initWithToken:@"ZIGGEO_APP_TOKEN" Delegate:self];];
```
- You can grab your appToken by logging [into your](https://ziggeo.com/signin) account and under application you will use > Overview you will see the app token.

### Recorder<a name="recorder"></a>

Ziggeo supports different media formats and offers multiple recorder options for you.
1. Video Camera Recorder
2. Video Screen Recorder
3. Audio Recorder
4. Image Capture (Snapshot Recorder)

Each will be showcased within its own section bellow.

- See [Configs](#configs) section bellow to see how to configure the recorder with more specific options, instead of using defaults

#### Video (Camera) Recorder<a name="video-recorder"></a>

To have your app capture video content from the camera, all you need is to use the following

```
	[m_ziggeo record];
```

#### Video (Screen) Recorder<a name="screen-recorder"></a>

By utilizing the following you will be creating a foreground service for screen recording

```
[m_ziggeo startScreenRecorder];
```

#### Audio Recorder<a name="audio-recorder"></a>

Audio Recorder is perfect when you want to capture the content that does not show the face or any imaging, focusing only on the audio aspect of the capture.

```
[m_ziggeo startAudioRecorder];
```

#### Image Capture<a name="image-capture"></a>
```
[m_ziggeo startImageRecorder];
```

#### Uploading <a name="upload-recorder"></a>

Sometimes you might want to upload something instead of showing the recorder. With the above, you can do the same.

**Upload From Path**
```
[m_ziggeo uploadFromPath:@"FILE_PATH" :@{}];
```

**Upload using File Selector**

```
NSMutableDictionary *data = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
//data[@"media_types"] = @[@"video", @"audio", @"image"];
[m_ziggeo uploadFromFileSelector:data];
```

### Player<a name="player"></a>

Capturing different types of media expects support for playback of the same. As such Ziggeo has a player for different type of media you might capture and use within your apps.

Ziggeo provides to following player:
1. Video Player
2. Audio Player

Each will be showcased within its own section bellow.

#### Video Player<a name="video-player"></a>

Player can be used to play local videos, videos from other services and of course videos from Ziggeo servers.

**Standard Playback**

```
[m_ziggeo playVideo:@"VIDEO_TOKEN"];
```

**Playback from third-party source**

```
[m_ziggeo playFromUri:Video_Url];
```

#### Audio Player<a name="audio-player"></a>

```
[m_ziggeo startAudioPlayer:@"AUDIO_TOKEN"];
```

#### Image Preview<a name="image-preview"></a>

```
[m_ziggeo showImage:@"IMAGE_TOKEN"];
```

### QR Scanner<a name="qr-scanner"></a>

QR Scanner makes it easy for your code to retrieve data from the captured QR code.

```
[m_ziggeo startQrScanner:@{}];
```

### Configs<a name="configs"></a>

Each embeddings (players and recorders) has default config and often a config you can set a bit differently if you wanted to.

This section will show you various options at your disposal.

#### Theming<a name="theming"></a>

Similar calls would be made for player as well as for the recorder. You can see available options bellow.

**Recorder**

```
NSMutableDictionary *map = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
map[@"hideRecorderControls"] = @"false";
[m_ziggeo setThemeArgsForRecorder:map];
```

**Player**

```
NSMutableDictionary *map = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
map[@"hidePlayerControls"] = @"false";
[m_ziggeo setThemeArgsForPlayer:map];
```

#### Recorder Config<a name="recorder-config"></a>

For uploading we are utilizing a helper config, while other parameters can be set up as they are needed.

```
NSDictionary *config = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:@"iOS_Choose_Media" forKey:@"tags"];
[m_ziggeo setUploadingConfig:config];
```

**Set max duration**

The duration of the recording is always set as endless, meaning there is no limit in how long your video or audio recording can be. The value for this is 0.

If you set it up with 30 this would be equal to 30 seconds of recording, after which the recording will be automatically stopped.

- When set, this time will also be used in the elapsed time indicator at the top-right corner.
- Note: Duration is in seconds.

```
[m_ziggeo setMaxRecordingDuration:30];
```

**Set countdown time**

When camera capture is started, the person might not be ready or might need to adjust the device before they are ready for capture. By default our recorder offers 3 seconds before the actual recording starts.

- Note: If you set it to 0, the person recording themselves might need to turn their phone, flip camera, or to align themselves first before they would actually start so we suggest keeping it somewhere within 2-5 seconds.

```
[m_ziggeo setStartDelay:3];
```

**Auto start recorder**

By default the recorder will show an option to start recording process. This is usually the preferred way for most use cases. In some use cases you might prefer that the recorder starts as soon as it is loaded up within the app. In such cases you can set the the following as true.

- Note: You might also want to check out `setStartDelay` as well.

```
[m_ziggeo setAutostartRecordingAfter:0];
```

**Set which camera you prefer**

This option allows you to select which camera should be used for recording. By default the back camera is used, however you can change it with this option.

- Note: You can choose `FRONT_CAMERA` or `REAR_CAMERA`

```
[m_ziggeo setCamera:REAR_CAMERA];
```

**Set the quality of recording**

Set the quality that you want to use for your video recording. Usually the higher the quality, the better, however in some specific usecases where quality is not as important you could use this option to change it.

- Note: You can choose `HighestQuality`, `MediumQuality` and `LowQuality`.

```
[m_ziggeo setQuality:MediumQuality];
```

**Forbid camera switch during recording**

By default we allow the camera to be switched within the recorder. Sometimes this might not be desirable, and if so you can forbid the ability to switch by setting this to true.

```
[m_ziggeo setCameraSwitchEnabled:YES];
```

**Submit videos immediately**

By default all videos are immediately sent to our servers. This allows them to be processed and to go through all of the workflows that you have set.
In some cases, you might want to show you button to confirm the video before it is sent or any other action you prefer, in which case you can delay this action.

```
[m_ziggeo setSendImmediately:YES];
```

**Streaming Recording**

Streaming recording mode will upload the video stream during the recording without caching to local file first. Video preview and video re-record are not available in this mode.

```
[m_ziggeo setLiveStreamingEnabled:YES];
```

**Enable Cover Selector Dialog**

This will allow you to change if the cover (Snapshot / Image / Poster) selection is shown or not.

```
[m_ziggeo setCoverSelectorEnabled:YES];
```

**Set Video Width**

If you want to set the resolution of the video, you would need to specify the width and height of the video. This will help you set the width. Please check `setVideoHeight` as well.

```
[m_ziggeo setVideoWidth:1920];
```

**Set Video Height**

If you want to set the resolution of the video, you would need to specify the width and height of the video. This will help you set the height. Please check `setVideoWidth` as well.

```
[m_ziggeo setVideoHeight:1080];
```

**Set Video Bitrate**

Setting video bitrate allows you to set specific bitrate that you want to have of your video.

- Note: Higher the bitrate, better the quality. The quality in turn will make the end video file be larger as well. Likewise smaller bitrate will result in smaller file footprint, however the visual data will show it.
- Note: bitrate is expressed in bytes

```
[m_ziggeo setVideoBitrate:1024 * 1024 * 2];
```

**Set Audio Bitrate**

Setting audio bitrate allows you to set up the quality of the audio captured. Higher the bitrate more data will be captured for single point in time. Lower the bitrate, lowever the quality will be, as well as file size.

- Note: bitrate is expressed in bytes

```
[m_ziggeo setAudioBitrate:128 * 1024];
```

**Set Audio Sample Rate**

Setting sample rate allows you to fine tune how many times per second we sample the mic information and save it as audio capture. We suggest leaving at 44100 for audio and 48000 for video if you want to set this manually.

```
[m_ziggeo setAudioSampleRate:44100];
```

**Set Blur Mode**

Sets the blur mode for the recorder, blurring out the background behind the person recording themselves.

```
[m_ziggeo setBlurMode:true];
```

**Set Extra Arguments**
This can be used to specify effect profiles, video profiles, custom data, tags, etc.

```
NSMutableDictionary *map = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
[m_ziggeo setExtraArgsForRecorder:map];
```

##### Extra arguments examples

**Working with Custom Data**

Custom data is set with extraArgs and represents a JSON Object as string. This custom-data can be anything that you want to attach to the media you are recording or uploading.

```
NSMutableDictionary *map = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
map[@"data"] = @{@"foo": @"bar"};

[m_ziggeo setExtraArgsForRecorder:map];
```

**Applying Effect Profile**

If you would like to add your logo or apply some effect to every video that you record or upload, you will want to use effect profiles. They can be used by specifying the effect profile token or key.

- Note: If you are using effect profile key, please add `_` (underscore) before the name, even if the name has underscore within it (the first underscore is removed to match the key you are specifying).

```
NSMutableDictionary *map = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
map[@"effect_profile"] = @"12345";

[m_ziggeo setExtraArgsForRecorder:map];
```

**Set Video Profile**

Video profiles allow you to create video in various resolutions of interest. For example if you want to upload a 1080p video and want to have its versions available in SD format as well, this would be the way to do it.

You can add the video profile token by adding video profile token or video profile key.

- Note: If you are using video profile key, please add `_` (underscore) before the name, even if the name has underscore within it (the first underscore is removed to match the key you are specifying).

```
NSMutableDictionary *map = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
map[@"video_profile"] = @"12345";

[m_ziggeo setExtraArgsForRecorder:map];
```

- Note: All recorders are using the same config class described above.

#### Player Config<a name="player-config"></a>

**Set Extra Arguments**

This can be used to specify effect profiles, video profiles, custom data, tags, etc.

```
[m_ziggeo setExtraArgsForPlayer:@{}];
```

**Set Player Cache Config**

If you want to modify the caching config, you should use the PlayerCacheConfig

```
[m_ziggeo setPlayerCacheConfig:@{}];
```

**Set Ads Url**

If you want to have the player show adds utilizing VAST, you can specify the link to your VAST manifest here. 

```
[m_ziggeo setAdsURL:@"ADS_URL"];
```

### Events / Callbacks<a name="events"></a>

Callbacks allow you to know when something happens. They fire in case of some event happening, such as if error occurs. This way you can design your app to fine detail and be able to provide you customers with great experience.

We have separated the events that are available to you into several different categories.

Before doing that, you will need to register a callback and this is done with the `ZiggeoDelegate`.

```
@interface ViewController : UIViewController <ZiggeoDelegate>
```

#### Global Callbacks<a name="callbacks-global"></a>

* No global callbacks are available at this time

#### Recorder Callbacks<a name="callbacks-recorder"></a>

The callbacks in this section are specific to recorder only. This means that they will not fire at all for the player embeds.

The callbacks are listed in the order that they should appear in within your code.

- Note: Some callbacks might not be called. For example if video is uploaded and not recorded, recording specific callbacks will never fire.

**Permissions**

Same callback will fire for both Success and Failure, you will need to check the argument passed over to see if access went through (true) or failed (false).

```
(void)checkCameraPermission:(BOOL)granted {
	// this method will return when camera access permission is granted or denied.
}

(void)checkMicrophonePermission:(BOOL)granted {
	// this method will return when microphone access permission is granted or denied.
}

(void)checkPhotoLibraryPermission:(BOOL)granted {
	// this method will return when photo library access permission is granted or denied.
}

```

**Camera availability**

Sometimes you might want to know that there is/are camera(s) available. This callback will fire to let you know if there are cameras or if there are none.

- Note: You will need to check the argument if there is camera detected (true) or not (false).

```
(void)checkHasCamera:(BOOL)hasCamera {
	// this method will return whether camera hardware is detected or not.
}
```

**Microphone availability**

Most devices will have microphone available. It could however happen that it is not available, or that it is completely disconnected.

- Note: You will need to check the argument if there is mic detected (true) or not (false).

```
(void)checkHasMicrophone:(BOOL)hasMicrophone {
	// this method will return whether microphone hardware is detected or not.
}
```

**Ready to record**

In most cases, once permissions are given, the recording can start and as such this callback will fire. It means that camera is ready and that all permissions are granted. All that is left is to start recording.

```
(void)ziggeoRecorderReady {
	// this method will be called when recorder is ready to recorder
}
```

**Recording has started**

This event fires once recording has just started. This is useful if you want to know that the video was recording and not upload since upload events will fire for all.

It can also be useful if you are using embedded recorder and you want to stop all other activities and bring more focus to the capture.

Standard Recording

```
(void)ziggeoRecorderStarted {
	// this method will be called when recorder is started
}
```

Streaming Recording

```
(void)ziggeoStreamingStarted {
	// Triggered when a streaming process has started (Press on the Record button if countdown 0 or after the countdown goes to 0)
}
```

- Note: Streaming is when recording is sent to Ziggeo servers as soon as recording happens. You need to turn this feature on to be utilized.

**Recording in progress**

This event is raised when recording is in process. This is a continuous update notification that will fire through entire duration of recording process.

- Note: `seconds` parameter will let you know how much time has passed since the recording had started.


```
(void)ziggeoRecorderCurrentRecordedDurationSeconds:(double)seconds {
	// this method will be called while recording
}
```

**Face Detected**

When face is detected on the video and if you are listening to the callback you will get information about the face. Please note that the face detection will not recognize who someone is, rather just a simple way of knowing that there is a face over the video.

- Note: If the same person leaves the video and comes back, they will have a different face ID even if it is the same person.

```
(void)faceDetected:(int)faceID rect:(CGRect)rect {
    // this method will be called when face is detected
}
```

**Recording cancelled**

Want to detect if someone cancels the recording? Use this event to know when someone cancelled the recording and closed the screen.

```
(void) ziggeoRecorderCanceled {
	// this method will be called when recorder is canceled
}
```

**Recording Finished**

This event will be raised when recording had just finished. It will happen in cases when the end user clicks on Stop button as well as if there was duration or size limit that was reached.


Standard recording

```
(void)ziggeoRecorderStopped:(NSString *)path {
	// this method will be called when recorder is stopped
}
```

Streaming Recording

```
(void)ziggeoStreamingStopped {
	// Triggered when a streaming process has stopped (automatically after reaching the maximum duration or manually).
}
```

**Confirm Recording**

Need to make sure someone confirms the video submission? Use this callback and record its action on your side as you like.

As this might be a requirement in some countries you are utilizing your app, you can easily use this for any sort of confirmation of captured video.

- Note: Our code only fires this event. It is up to you to then use this event to capture and save that someone confirmed the use of the video and in what way. This is done so as it offers you most flexibility in what you want to do and how.

```
(void)ziggeoRecorderManuallySubmitted {
	// this method will be called when recorded file(video or audio) is uploaded by the user
}
```

**Re-Recording**

Rerecording is a common way to provide the end user of capturing multiple samples before they have one that they are satisfied with to submit.

```
(void)ziggeoRecorderRerecord {
	// this method will be called when recorder is rerecorded
}
```

**Uploading started**

Want to know when upload starts? In that case you will want to listen to this event. It will be raised every time uploads start to happen.

```
(void)preparingToUploadWithPath:(NSString*)sourcePath {
	// this method will be called first before any Ziggeo API interaction
}
```

This will be followed by:

```
(void)uploadStartedWithPath:(NSString*)sourcePath token:(NSString*)token streamToken:(NSString *)streamToken backgroundTask:(NSURLSessionTask*)uploadingTask {
	// this method will be called on actual file(video, audio, image) upload start after empty file(video, audio, image) creation on Ziggeo platform
}
```

If by some chance it turns out to fail, then other callback would be raised to help detect this:
```
(void)failedToUploadWithPath:(NSString*)sourcePath {
	// this method will be called when file(video, audio, image) uploading was failed
}
```

**Upload progress**

Do you want to know the progress of the uploads? This event will be continuously raised as the uploaded data changes, allowing you to track the progress of every upload.  

```
(void)uploadProgressForPath:(NSString*)sourcePath token:(NSString*)token streamToken:(NSString *)streamToken totalBytesSent:(int)bytesSent totalBytesExpectedToSend:(int)totalBytes {
	// this method will be called while uploading the file(video, audio, image)
}
```

- Note: Please note that during the upload progress you can always stop the upload by calling `cancelUpload` as per following:

```
[m_ziggeo cancelUpload:path :delete_file];
```

**Upload finished**

Want to know once upload finishes? Then you would want to listen to this event. Our SDK will raise it once all uploading is complete.

```
(void)uploadFinishedForPath:(NSString*)sourcePath token:(NSString*)token streamToken:(NSString *)streamToken {
	// this method will be called after the file(video, audio, image) was uploaded
}
```

**Media Verified**

Do you want to know if the media just uploaded can be processed? In most cases this is true, however in rare cases, it might not be possible.

This utilizes our quick check algorithm to inspect the media before it is sent to processing to see that it can actually be processed. This allows you to react if something is wrong with the media, before the processing stages. It also offers you a way to skip the processing stages, since once verified client side code can do anything, even if not related to the media.

```
(void)uploadVerifiedWithPath:(NSString*)sourcePath token:(NSString*)token streamToken:(NSString *)streamToken withResponse:(NSURLResponse*)response error:(NSError*)error json:(NSDictionary*)json {
	// this method will be called when file(video, audio, image) upload finished successfully or failed
}
```

**Processing**

While we do not offer an insight into how much of the media was processed, we can tell you how long it is going for. This event will be raised for the entire duration of media processing.

```
(void)uploadProcessingWithPath:(NSString *)sourcePath token:(NSString *)token streamToken:(NSString *)streamToken {
	// this method will be called while processing the file(video, audio, image)
}
```

**Processing Finished**

Interested in knowing when the media is successfully processed? Listening for this event will allow you to know just that. As soon as it fires, the media is available for playback

```
(void)uploadProcessedWithPath:(NSString *)sourcePath token:(NSString *)token streamToken:(NSString *)streamToken {
	// this method will be called when uploading the file(video, audio, image) was finished by ziggeo servers
}
```

#### Player Callbacks<a name="callbacks-player"></a>

We differentiate between player and the player shown automatically immediately after recording. You will find events for both types here.

**Media playback available**

Want to know once the player can play the video? This event will let you know once the media is available for playback. By listening to it, you can avoid listening to progress events as it will fire once the media is ready regardless if it has to be processed first, or if it is waiting to download the media to make it available for playback

```
(void)ziggeoPlayerReadyToPlay {
	// Triggered when a video player is ready to play a video
}
```

**Playback started**

Want to react when playback is started? This event will be raised every time the playback is started.

Standard player

```
(void)ziggeoPlayerPlaying {
	// Fires any time a playback is started
}
```

Player after recording

```
(void)ziggeoRecorderPlaying {
	// this method will be called when recorder plays the recorded audio
}
```

**Playback paused**

What to react when someone pause's the video?. This event will be raised when the Pause button is clicked.

- Note: It will also fire at the end of the video

```
(void)ziggeoPlayerPaused {
	// Fires when the pause button is clicked (and at the end of the video)
}
```

Player after recording

```
(void)ziggeoRecorderPaused {
	// this method will be called when recorder pauses the playback of recorded media
}
```

**Playback Ended**

Want to know when the media playback ends? This event will be raised any time the playback reaches the end of media length.

```
(void)ziggeoPlayerEnded {
	// Fires when a video playback has ended (reaches the end)
}
```

**Playback seeking**

Want to know if and where to someone changes the point of playback (seeks the media)? This event will be raised when the person watching the media moves the player's progress indicator to a new position. This will fire for both going forward as well as going back in playback.

- Note: The value returned will be milliseconds of time when seek operation was set to, looking from the start.

```
(void)ziggeoPlayerSeek:(double)positionMillis {
	// Triggered when the user moves the progress indicator to continue video playback from a different position
}
```

#### Sensor Callbacks<a name="callbacks-sensor"></a>

**Lightning conditions**

Want to know lightning conditions? Our light sensor even will be raised every second to provide you with a value of how light / dark the environment seems.

- Note: Our SDK is checking {@link Sensor.TYPE_LIGHT} value

```
(void)luxMeter:(double)luminousity {
	//
}
```

**Microphone levels**

Are you interested in knowing microphone health status? This event will be raised every second with the information about the recorder amplitude.

```
(void)audioMeter:(double)audioLevel {
	//
}
```

### API<a name="api"></a>

#### Request Cancellation<a name="api-cancel"></a>

* This is not available in our iOS SDK at this time

#### Videos API<a name="api-videos"></a>

* This is not available in our iOS SDK at this time

#### Video Streams API<a name="api-video-streams"></a>

* This is not available in our iOS SDK at this time

### Authentication<a name="authentication"></a>

Our API is utilizing patent pending authorization token system. It allows you to secure and fine tune what someone can do and for how long.

The following will be needed if you have enabled the authorization tokens in your app.

- Note: This shows you how to add and utilize auth tokens. On client side, the auth tokens should never be created, nor stored permanently. Ideally, you will create the auth tokens within your server and then if you decide, pass that token to the specific client to allow them to do something within certain timeframe. Hardcoding permanent auth tokens would make it possible for anyone to find them and use, regardless of your desired workflow just by inspecting your app code.

Both client and server side auth tokens have equal say in what one can do. The difference is in how they are created.

#### Client Auth<a name="authentication-client"></a>

This section helps you set up a client auth token to be used in the requests you send to our servers. The client auth is created on your server without reaching to our servers first. This is ideal for high speed communication.

```
NSMutableDictionary *map = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
map[@"client_auth"] = @"CLIENT_AUTH_TOKEN";

[m_ziggeo setExtraArgsForRecorder:map];
```

#### Server Auth<a name="authentication-server"></a>

The following will help you utilize the server side auth tokens. The server side auth tokens are created on your server as well, however they are created by passing the grants object to our server. Our server then sends you a short token that you can use in any of the calls you make, per the grants you specified.

```

## Compiling and Publishing App<a name="compile"></a>

### Building/Packaging App
- Using `universal` framework is ideal for building apps that run on simulators and actual devices.
  See: iOS-Client-SDK/Output/ directory

### Preparing App for submission to App Store
- Create "new run script phase" in the application target build settings to strip unused architectures. Use the script provided with the iOS-Client-SDK/TestApp_ example (TestApp target settings -> Build phases -> Run script section)
